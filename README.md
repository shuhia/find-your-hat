- NodeJS - v14.17.1

List the ready features here:

- win or lose. 
- Holes: "O"
- Hat: "^"
- Player path: "*"

## Screenshots

## Setup
- To run this game: start by cloning the project. 
- then on the console: enter npm install // This installs the game (installs required dependencies)
- start the game by typing: node main.js 

## Usage
- move player by entering u,d,l or r. 
- Try to get to ^ without falling into the holes.

## Project Status
Project is: complete 


## Room for Improvement
- The game should indicate where the player are. The first * is always the player. You can do it by creating a blink effect by replacing it with empty space every second. 
- The game controls could be changed to use the standard buttons: w,a,s,d or up, down, left, right arrows.
